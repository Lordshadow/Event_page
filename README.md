Welcome to My Repository!

This is a small projectâ€”a simple web page designed for an event. I had a lot of fun creating it and adding various elements I wanted to include.

Technologies Used:
HTML

CSS

How to View My Web Page in 3 Simple Steps:
Download the Event Page folder.

Open the Event Page folder.

Double-click the HTML file. If prompted, select Google Chrome as the browser.

I have also uploaded an image of the event page for reference.

Hope you like it! ðŸš€
